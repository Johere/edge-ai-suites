"""Prefilter model registry — the allowlist of selectable prefilter models.

A monitor names a model by registry key (`prefilter.model`), never by path. The
keys come from `prefilter_models` in config.yaml, so every path that reaches
`openvino.Core().read_model()` is deployment-authored rather than
request-supplied.

Registration alone does not make a model selectable. An entry must also pass
every check in `_validate`, and only entries that do are returned as available;
the rest come back as rejections carrying the reason, which is what
`GET /capabilities/prefilter` reports to operators. A typo, a half-copied IR
pair, or a model whose output is not a detection tensor is therefore visible as
a diagnostic instead of surfacing later as a stream that silently runs without
a prefilter.
